**Title:**
Website crashes repeatedly on mobile â€” "(https://www.qustodio.com/) has repeatedly caused problems" error on iPhone 13"

**Description:**
When accessing the website from a mobile browser (tested on iPhone 13), the site fails to load and repeatedly crashes. Safari displays an error message:
**"https://www.qustodio.com/ has repeatedly caused problems"**, preventing further interaction with the site.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Open Safari on an iPhone 13.
2. Navigate to the website: (https://www.qustodio.com/).
3. Wait for the page to load or try to interact with it.
4. Observe that the browser shows an error and reloads or crashes.

**Expected Result:**
The website should load and function normally on mobile devices, particularly on Safari for iOS.

**Actual Result:**
The browser displays a repeated crash error:
**"https://www.qustodio.com/ has repeatedly caused problems"**, and the website fails to load.

**Impact:**
The website is completely inaccessible to users on certain mobile devices, blocking access and affecting usability, especially for parents managing routines or settings on the go.

**Environment:**

* Device: iPhone 13
* iOS Version: iOS 18.5
* Browser: Safari (default)
* Network: Wi-Fi and Cellular (tested both)
* Date/Time of issue: 03/07/2025

**Additional Notes:**
This may be related to a frontend crash (e.g., infinite render loop, memory leak, or uncaught JavaScript error) affecting only mobile Safari.
